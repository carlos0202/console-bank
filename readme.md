Assignment: C# Application Development Project

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to assess your understanding and application of the fundamental concepts of C# 10, including syntax, object-oriented development, and working with classes from the .NET class library.

Description:
You are required to develop a console-based application in C# 10 that simulates a simple banking system. The application should allow users to perform various banking operations, such as creating an account, making deposits and withdrawals, checking the account balance, and transferring funds between accounts.

Requirements:

1. Account Class:
   - Implement a class called "Account" that represents a bank account. The class should have the following attributes:
     - Account number (auto-generated and unique for each account)
     - Account holder name
     - Account balance

   - Include appropriate constructors and properties to set and retrieve the account details.

2. Main Menu:
   - Display a main menu with the following options:
     a. Create Account
     b. Deposit
     c. Withdraw
     d. Check Balance
     e. Transfer Funds
     f. Exit

3. Create Account:
   - When the user selects this option, prompt them to enter the account holder name and create a new account with an auto-generated account number. Add the account to a collection or an array.

4. Deposit:
   - Prompt the user to enter the account number and the deposit amount. Update the account balance accordingly.

5. Withdraw:
   - Prompt the user to enter the account number and the withdrawal amount. Ensure that the account has sufficient funds before allowing the withdrawal.

6. Check Balance:
   - Prompt the user to enter the account number and display the current account balance.

7. Transfer Funds:
   - Prompt the user to enter the account numbers of the sender and recipient accounts, as well as the transfer amount. Deduct the transfer amount from the sender's account and add it to the recipient's account.

8. Exit:
   - Terminate the application when the user selects this option.

Guidelines:

- Utilize appropriate control structures, such as decision statements and loops, to implement the menu-driven functionality.
- Implement exception handling to handle any possible errors, such as insufficient funds or invalid account numbers.
- Store the created accounts in a data structure of your choice (e.g., list, array, or dictionary) to keep track of multiple accounts.
- Ensure that the account numbers are generated uniquely for each account.
- Validate user inputs to handle any incorrect or invalid inputs.
- Use meaningful variable and method names, and maintain appropriate code formatting and indentation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Correct implementation of the required functionality.
2. Proper utilization of C# 10 syntax, including decision and iteration statements, methods, and operators.
3. Effective use of object-oriented development concepts, such as classes and objects.
4. Proper handling of exceptions and validation of user inputs.
5. Code organization, readability, and adherence to coding conventions.

Note: This assignment aims to assess your understanding of C# 10 fundamentals. You are encouraged to explore additional features and concepts beyond the mentioned requirements to further enhance your application.
